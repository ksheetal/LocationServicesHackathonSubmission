# Problem Statement
## Last Mile:
The "last mile" is the final leg of a process that delivers products or services to one or more end users. The goal is to cross this last mile as efficiently as possible while providing a great user experience for the customer.

From Ride Hailing Perspective this would mean the driver being able to pick the passenger from the exact pick-up location (passengers' origin) and drop off (passengers' destination) at the exact location smoothly. The driver should be able to reach the pick-up/drop off location accurately as it not only provides convenience but saves time and money for the end consumer. This would also help improve fleet optimization, Costs (fuel, fines, damages, reroutes). At times, the fare calculations, dispatch of fleet efficiently is impacted without proper last mile details.

From an E-Commerce Perspective this would mean delivery of packages in a timely and consistent manner with minimum impact from traffic complications, unreliable infrastructure and non-standardized addresses in India. This would also mean ensuring proper last mile connectivity to be able to meet client expectations like same day delivery, precise ETA commitments as this is one of the key differentiators for them.

Today, the challenge for ride hailing and E-Commerce companies is bridging the last mile connectivity gap which can be done using location content and services. This can bring in significant competitive advantage for these companies and benefit the end consumer as well as almost a third of the cost of delivering goods comes because of improper last mile, which is often passed on to the consumer.

**Note that ride-hailing and e-commerce are just examples. Feel free to be creative and come up with solutions for any kind of business or case facing the last mile problem.**
